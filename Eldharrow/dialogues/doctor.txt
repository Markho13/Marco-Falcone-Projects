DOCTOR: "You really want to know what i saw?
Fine. But once i tell you, there is no turning back.
And if they come for me... I l say you forced me ."

He glances at the closed door, then lowers his voice trembling slightly.

DOCTOR:"The bodies… they weren't just torn. They were desecrated.
Like something was playing with them. Testing them.
And every time - no blood. Not a drop.
The chest, the neck - These same two punctures, always pvrecise.
Almost… surgical."

He leans closer, voice hoarse.

DOCTOR:"You know what drains a body like that?
Not wolves. no bears.
But i' m not allowed to say that word. Not in this town.
They think i' m mad. Maybe i am. 
But I know what I saw.
And so do they. The Mayor. The sheriff.
They are covering it up."

He shivers, then steps back.

DOCTOR: "If the old hunter's still out there...
He might be the only one who can help her.
Or stop this.
He lived in a small house in the north of the forest.
But no one saw him for long time..."
