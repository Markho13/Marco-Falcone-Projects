You arrive at the old mine.
It s gapping mouth looms before you, surrounded by broken fences and half-collapsed scaffolding.
The silence is unnatural - not a bird, not a breeze.
You step cautiously into the entrance.
the air is thick with dust and iron. the rock walls weep with moisture, and the echo of your footsteps vanishes into
endless tunnels.
Rotten wooden tracks creak beneath your boots, and rusted lanterns sway above your head - though there's no wind.
A sharp sound behind you. You turn. Nothing.
But instinct screams at you to leave.
One more stepâ€¦ and the ground trembles ever so slightly beneath your feet.
there's something in the dark.
something watching you.
You brace yourself.
Suddenly, a deafening screech pierces the silence.
Form the darkness above, a massive shape drops down - a bat the size of a fully grown, muscular man, its eyes burning red with fury.
You barely menage to roll to the side before its claws slam into the ground where you stood.
Combat begins!
