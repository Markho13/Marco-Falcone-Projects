The Baron approaches you with a calculating smile.



Baron:

“I really hope you find the girl. It would be a shame if something went wrong…”



You:

“You’re not here to help, are you?”



Baron:

“Oh, come on. All I want is peace in this town. But I’d advise you to leave it alone—the mine is no place for you.”



You:

“I won’t be intimidated by you.”



Baron:

“You’re stubborn. Then go ahead to the mine… but remember, you’ve stepped into a game much bigger than yourself.”
