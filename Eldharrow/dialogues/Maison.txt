You arrive at the mansion in the dim light. In the large hall, a woman sits on an old chair, her gaze lost in emptiness, wrapped in a veil of sadness and regret.



Baron’s Mother (hoarse voice, almost whispering):

“I was an ordinary woman until the day my son was wounded during a hunting trip. A bear nearly killed him. To save him, I made a dark pact with a vampire. First, I was turned, then he was. I thought it was the only way to keep him alive… but I was wrong.”



She pauses, eyes full of pain.



“To live, I have to do harm… and my son’s heart has grown corrupt, becoming what he is now.”



Baron’s Mother (almost whispering):

“I know why you’re here. You want to stop my son.

I cannot let you.”



Suddenly she rises, showing unexpected strength, and attacks you.
