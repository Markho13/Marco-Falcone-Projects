To the Faithful Servants of the Light,

The Holy See entrusts you with a mission of utmost delicacy and gravity.

From Eldharrow, an isolated village on the edge of the consecrated lands, dark whispers arise.
There is talk of unexplained disappearances, forbidden rituals and a fear that clings to the hearts of its people like a sticky mist.

The last report spoke of a young woman who vanished without a trace.

We fear that the roots of Evil may have taken hold in that place-either unbeknownst to or with the complicity if the population.

Your task is to bring Light where now only Shadow reigns.Find the woman, investigate and if necessary, purify.

May Truth be your guide,
Ordo Lux Dei - Sanctum Sigillum
