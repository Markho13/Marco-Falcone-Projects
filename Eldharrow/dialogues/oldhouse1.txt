You reach the old hut at the top of the hill.
The structure is crumbling, covered in moss. The windows are shattered. The door swing ajarOn, creaking in the wind.
Inside, darkness.
The stench of damp, rotten wood, and dust hits you instantly.
Broken furniture. Scattered junk. Rusted cutlery.
Abandoned for years… yet something fells off.
On a table, among the filth-a journal.
Surprisingly clean, well preserved.
You pick it up, curious.
Beneath it, a piece of rusted metal.
It slices your finger as you lift the book. A clean cut. a drop of blood lands on the cover.
Next to the journal, an oil lamp. Still warm.
Someone is here. Or was, just moments ago.
Behind you, the door creaks  shut slowly.
You turn.
A man. Tall, gaunt, hallow-eyed.
He still wears a hunter's coat- ragged, stained.
His grey beard frames a face etched with hunger and sorrow.
"You … you are human? Truly human?"
His voice is raspy, broken.
"I stayed here … away from everyone … to do no harm. i resisted but now, now you are here."
"Kill me. Please do it. Before i-"
He stops.
His eyes fall on your finger. Still bleeding.
Silence
Then a low hiss
His face twist. Fangs emerge.
He smell the blood.
Too late.
